# sample_spark_project

### This repository gives fundamental idea on the use of the sparkRDDs and sparkSQL for big data processing.

An uber jar must be generated which can then be used to run the spark application locally.
Maven can be used to build the jar file.

The command is: **mvn package**.

Then running the spark application can be done using the commands from: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html).
